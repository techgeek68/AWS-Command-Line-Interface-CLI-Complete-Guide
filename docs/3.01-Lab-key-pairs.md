# Lab: Creating Key Pairs in AWS Management Console

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for creating an EC2 Key Pair using the AWS Management Console. Key Pairs are essential for securely connecting to Linux and Windows EC2 instances.

## What is a Key Pair?

A **Key Pair** in AWS consists of a public key (stored by AWS) and a private key (downloaded by you). Itâ€™s used to securely access EC2 instances:
- **Linux**: via SSH authentication.
- **Windows**: for decrypting the Administrator password for RDP access.

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to manage EC2 resources.
- Web browser.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Sign Into AWS Management Console

1. Open [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) in your browser.
2. Click **Sign In to the Console**.
3. Enter your credentials and complete MFA if prompted.

---

### 2. Navigate to EC2 Key Pair Section

1. In the AWS Console home page, type **EC2** in the search bar and select **EC2**.
2. On the EC2 Dashboard, look for the **Network & Security** section in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Key Pairs**.

### 3. Create a New Key Pair

1. Click the **Create key pair** button (top-right of Key Pairs page).
2. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: Enter a unique name (e.g., `MyLabKeyPair`).
   - **Key pair type**:
     - **RSA**: Compatible with most SSH clients.
     - **ED25519**: Offers stronger security and performance (check compatibility).
   - **Private key file format**:
     - **.pem**: Standard for Linux, MacOS, and most SSH clients.
     - **.ppk**: For PuTTY (Windows).
3. (Optional) Enable **Key pair tags** for organization and cost tracking.
4. Click **Create key pair**.

### 4. Download and Store the Private Key

- The private key file (`.pem` or `.ppk`) will automatically download to your computer.
- **Important:** AWS does NOT store your private key. If lost, you cannot download it again.
- Store the key file in a secure, private location. Never share it with others.

---

### 5. Verify Key Pair Creation

- The new key pair appears in the Key Pairs list.
- You can now use this key pair when launching EC2 instances.
- For SSH access: set correct permissions (Linux/Mac):
  ```sh
  chmod 400 /path/to/MyLabKeyPair.pem
  ```
- For PuTTY: use `.ppk` file or convert `.pem` using PuTTYgen.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Security:** Never share your private key. Limit permissions to your user.
- **Backup:** Store a backup in a secure location (e.g., encrypted USB or password manager).
- **Naming:** Use descriptive names for key pairs (e.g., project, environment, owner).
- **Organization:** Tag key pairs for better resource management.

---

## Cleanup

- Delete unused key pairs to reduce risk.
  1. Select the key pair in the list.
  2. Click **Delete**.

**Congratulations!**  
You have successfully created an EC2 Key Pair in AWS Management Console.
