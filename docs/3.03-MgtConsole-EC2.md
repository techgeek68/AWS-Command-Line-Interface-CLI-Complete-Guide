## Step 1: Sign Into AWS Management Console

1. Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Click **Sign In to the Console**.
3. Enter your credentials:
   - SSO user (production) or IAM user (development/learning).
   - MFA prompt: Enter your one-time code if prompted.
4. Click **Sign In**.
5. Ensure you’re in the correct region (top-right dropdown, e.g., `us-east-1`).

---

## Step 2: Navigate to EC2 Dashboard

1. In the AWS Console, enter `EC2` in the search bar at the top.
2. Select **EC2** from the suggestions.
3. Verify you’re on the correct region’s EC2 Dashboard.

---

## Step 3: Launch Instance Wizard

1. Click the orange **Launch Instance** button.
2. The wizard opens with **Name and tags** at the top.

---

## Step 4: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

**What is an AMI?**  
An **Amazon Machine Image** (AMI) is a template that contains the software configuration (OS, application server, applications) needed to launch your instance.

1. In **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**, browse or search for your desired OS:
   - Common: **Amazon Linux**, **Ubuntu**, **Windows Server**, etc.
2. Click **Select** beside the AMI you want.
3. Review architecture (x86, ARM), storage, and support.
4. Confirm your selection.

---

## Step 5: Choose an Instance Type

**What is an Instance Type?**  
An **instance type** defines the hardware (CPU, memory, storage, networking) of your EC2 instance.

1. Review available instance types (e.g., `t2.micro` for free tier).
2. Compare vCPU, RAM, network, and pricing.
3. Select your instance type.
4. Click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

---

## Step 6: Configure Instance Details

**VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**  
A logically isolated section of AWS where you launch AWS resources.

**Subnet:**  
A range of IP addresses in your VPC, mapping to an availability zone.

**IAM Role:**  
Allows your instance to access AWS services securely.

1. Set **Number of instances** (usually 1).
2. Choose a **Network** (VPC) and **Subnet** (availability zone).
3. Enable **Auto-assign Public IP** for direct access (recommended for beginners).
4. (Optional) Assign an **IAM role** for instance permissions.
5. Enable **Monitoring** if needed.
6. Click **Next: Add Storage**.

---

## Step 7: Add Storage (EBS)

**EBS (Elastic Block Store):**  
Block storage volumes for use with EC2.

1. Review default root volume (size, type).
2. To add storage:
   - Click **Add New Volume**.
   - Set volume type (`gp3`, `io2`, etc.), size, and encryption as needed.
3. Click **Next: Add Tags**.

---

## Step 8: Add Tags (Optional)

**Tags:**  
Key-value pairs that help identify and organize AWS resources.

1. Click **Add Tag**.
2. Enter a **Key** (e.g., `Name`) and **Value** (e.g., `MyFirstEC2`).
3. Add more tags as needed (environment, owner, project).
4. Click **Next: Configure Security Group**.

---

## Step 9: Configure Security Group

**Security Group:**  
Acts as a virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic.

1. Choose **Create new security group** or **Select existing group**.
2. Add inbound rules:
   - **Linux (SSH):** Type=`SSH`, Protocol=`TCP`, Port=`22`, Source=`My IP` (restrict for security).
   - **Windows (RDP):** Type=`RDP`, Protocol=`TCP`, Port=`3389`, Source=`My IP`.
   - Add **HTTP/HTTPS** as needed.
3. Name the security group descriptively.
4. Click **Review and Launch**.

**Best Practice:** Restrict access to your IP, never use `0.0.0.0/0` unless absolutely necessary for testing.

---

## Step 10: Create or Select a Key Pair

**Key Pair:**  
A public/private key set is required to securely access your instance.

1. When prompted, select an existing key pair or create a new one.
2. To create a new key pair:
   - Enter a unique name.
   - Choose file format: `.pem` (Linux/Mac/WSL) or `.ppk` (Windows/PuTTY).
   - Click **Create key pair**.
   - Download and store the file securely (never share).
3. Ensure you have access to the private key before proceeding.

---

## Step 11: Review and Launch Instance

1. Review all instance configuration and security settings.
2. Click **Launch Instance**.
3. Confirm key pair selection.
4. Click **View Instances**.
5. Wait for the instance **State** to be `running`.

---

## Step 12: Connect to Your Instance

### Linux Instance (SSH)

1. Select your running instance in EC2.
2. Click **Connect** (top-right).
3. Go to the **SSH** tab.
4. Copy the provided SSH command, e.g.:
   ```
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP-address>
   ```
5. Ensure your key file permissions are secure:
   ```
   chmod 400 /path/to/your-key.pem
   ```
6. Paste the SSH command in your terminal and connect.

**Note:**  
- For Ubuntu AMI, use `ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>`.
- For Amazon Linux, use `ec2-user@<Public-IP-address>`.

---

### Windows Instance (RDP)

1. Select your running Windows instance.
2. Click **Connect**, then **RDP client**.
3. Click **Get Password**.
   - Upload your `.pem` key.
   - Click **Decrypt Password**.
4. Click on the `Download remote desktop file` file and open it.
5. Use `Administrator` as username, and the decrypted password.
6. Accept any security warnings and connect.

---

## Security, Billing, and Cleanup

### Security

- Never share your private key (.pem or .ppk).
- Restrict security groups to known IP addresses.
- Delete unused key pairs and security groups.

### Billing

- EC2 instances incur charges while running.
- Stop or terminate instances when not needed.
- Monitor usage in the Billing Dashboard.

### Cleanup

- Terminate test instances.
- Remove unused resources to avoid accidental charges.
