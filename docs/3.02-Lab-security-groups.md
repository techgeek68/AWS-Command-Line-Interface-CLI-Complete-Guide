# Lab: Creating Security Groups in AWS Management Console

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for creating Security Groups in AWS. Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances.

---

## What is a Security Group?

A **Security Group** is a set of rules that control network traffic to and from AWS resources, mainly EC2 instances. You can specify allowed IP ranges, protocols, and ports for both inbound and outbound connections.

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to manage EC2 resources.
- Web browser.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Sign in to AWS Management Console

1. Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Click **Sign In to the Console**.
3. Enter your credentials and complete MFA if prompted.

---

### 2. Navigate to EC2 Security Group Section

1. In the AWS Console home page, type **EC2** in the search bar and select **EC2**.
2. On the EC2 Dashboard, locate the **Network & Security** section in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Security Groups**.

---

### 3. Create a New Security Group

1. Click the **Create security group** button (top-right of Security Groups page).
2. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Security group name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `MyLabSG`).
   - **Description**: Briefly explain the purpose (e.g., `Allow SSH and HTTP access for lab`).
   - **VPC**: Select the VPC to associate this security group with.

### 4. Add Inbound Rules

**Inbound rules** allow traffic **to** your resources.

1. Click **Add rule**.
2. Set the following for each rule:
   - **Type**: Choose the protocol/service (e.g., SSH, RDP, HTTP).
   - **Protocol**: Auto-fills based on type.
   - **Port range**: Auto-fills or specify a custom port.
   - **Source**: Set to `My IP` (recommended for SSH/RDP) or a specific IP/CIDR.
     - For testing, you may temporarily use `0.0.0.0/0` (not recommended for production).
3. Example rules:
   - SSH: Type=`SSH`, Port=`22`, Source=`My IP`
   - RDP: Type=`RDP`, Port=`3389`, Source=`My IP`
   - HTTP: Type=`HTTP`, Port=`80`, Source=`0.0.0.0/0`
   - HTTPS: Type=`HTTPS`, Port=`443`, Source=`0.0.0.0/0`
4. Add multiple rules as needed.

---

### 5. Add Outbound Rules (Optional)

**Outbound rules** allow traffic **from** your resources.

- By default, all outbound traffic is allowed.
- To restrict, click **Add rule** and specify destination, protocol, and port.

---

### 6. Review and Create the Security Group

1. Review the security group name, description, VPC, and all rules.
2. Click **Create security group**.

---

### 7. Attach Security Group to EC2 Instance

- When launching a new EC2 instance, select your security group in the **Configure Security Group** step.
- To attach to an existing instance:
  1. Go to **Instances** in the EC2 Dashboard.
  2. Select your instance.
  3. Click **Actions** > **Security** > **Change security groups**.
  4. Add or remove security groups as required.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Restrict Access:** Always restrict SSH/RDP to your IP for security.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use meaningful names and descriptions.
- **Least Privilege:** Only open required ports and protocols.
- **Review Regularly:** Audit and clean up unused security groups and rules.

---

## Cleanup

- Delete unused security groups to reduce risk.
  1. Select the security group in the list.
  2. Click **Delete**.
