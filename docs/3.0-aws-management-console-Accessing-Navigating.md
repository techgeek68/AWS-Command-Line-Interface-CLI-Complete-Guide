# AWS Management Console Access & Navigation Guide

**For:** New Cloud Engineers  
**Applies to:** Dev & Production | Windows, macOS, Linux | Example Region: us-east-1

---

## 1. What is the AWS Management Console?

The AWS Management Console is your web dashboard for working with AWS services. Think of it as AWS’s “control room”—you’ll use it to launch servers, manage storage, set permissions, and more.

**Why secure access matters:**  
If you don’t set up access correctly, you risk exposing data, racking up surprise bills, or violating company policy.

---

## 2. Before You Begin: What You’ll Need

- **AWS account info**:  
  - Account ID & Name  
  - Organization/OU (if applicable)
- **How you’ll log in**:  
  - Production: SSO portal (`<SSO_PORTAL_URL>`)  
  - Development: IAM user credentials
- **Security device**:  
  - MFA app (Google Authenticator, Authy) or hardware token
- **Your user provisioned**:  
  - Either IAM or SSO user, with proper roles

---

## 3. Security Checklist

| Must-Do | Dev | Prod |
|---|---|---|
| Use MFA | Recommended | **Required** |
| Use SSO | Optional | **Required** |
| IAM user console access | OK | **Disable** |
| Root account | Setup only | **Emergencies only** |
| Least privilege | Yes | Yes |
| Audit logins | Yes | Yes |

---

## 4. Setting Up Access

### 4.1 Create AWS Account

1. Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) → **Create an AWS Account**
2. Enter your info, organization, and payment details.
3. Verify by phone/email.
4. Choose a support plan (start with **Basic**)
5. Set a strong root password and **enable MFA** right away.

> **Tip:** Never use the root account for daily tasks!

---

### 4.2 User Setup & Login

#### A. Developer Access (IAM User)

1. Log in as root at [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) (for setup only)
2. Go to:  
   `Services` → `IAM` → `Users` → **Add user**
3. Username: `<YOUR_USERNAME>`
4. Enable Console access, set password (require reset).
5. Assign to a group (e.g. `ReadOnlyAccess`)
6. Save credentials (use a password manager).
7. Log in as IAM user.

**CLI alternative:**  
```bash
aws iam create-user --user-name <YOUR_USERNAME>
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <YOUR_USERNAME> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
```

#### B. Production Access (SSO)

1. Set up [IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
2. Choose your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
3. Disable IAM user console login:  
   `IAM` → `Users` → `<username>` → `Security credentials` → **Deactivate Console access**
4. Confirm only SSO users have console access.

---

### 4.3 Setting Up MFA

- IAM Users:  
  `IAM` → `Users` → `<username>` → `Security credentials` → **Assign MFA device**
- SSO:  
  Enforce via your identity provider’s settings.
- Use your MFA app or hardware key, scan the QR, and enter two codes.

---

### Step-by-Step: Explore the Console

1. Log in with your IAM or SSO credentials.
2. Use the Search Bar to find a service (e.g., “S3”).
3. Pin your favorites for quick access (hover on a service, click pin).
4. Check your account menu for role switching and settings.
5. Monitor costs by visiting the Billing Dashboard.
6. Explore the Resource Center for tutorials and news.

---

### Role Switching

1. Click your account name (top right) → **Switch Role**
2. Fill in:
   - Account ID: `<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>`
   - Role name: `<ROLE_NAME>`
   - Display name/color (optional)
3. Click **Switch Role**
4. Confirm your new role at the top.

---

## 6. Verification Steps

- Username/role shows at the top right.
- Try accessing a resource (e.g., S3 bucket) to test permissions.
- Login should require MFA.
- Check CloudTrail for console login events.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied:**  
  - Check group/role assignment.
  - Validate policy in IAM.
- **MFA Issues:**  
  - Re-sync or re-enroll the device in IAM.
- **Role Switch Error:**  
  - Check trust relationships and policies.
- **Console access disabled:**  
  - Review SSO and IAM settings.

---

## 8. Cleaning Up

- Remove unused IAM users/roles.
- Detach unnecessary permissions.
- Delete test resources.
- Review tags and billing for “orphaned” assets.

**CLI tip:**  
```bash
aws iam list-users
aws iam delete-user --user-name <USERNAME>
```

---

## 9. Cost Management

- IAM users/groups are free.
- Only created resources (EC2, S3, etc.) cost money.
- Use the Billing Dashboard and Cost Explorer (Console → Billing) to track spending.

---

## 10. Best Practices

- Use SSO for production always.
- Remove console access for IAM users in prod.
- Enforce MFA everywhere.
- Audit logins, permissions, and resource usage.
- Tag resources for projects/cost tracking.
- Set billing alerts and budgets.

---

## 11. Minimal IAM Policy Example

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```
*Allows listing S3 buckets. Lock down permissions further in production!*
